This is becoming a website for EEL throughout the next weeks.

This is being developed in Python 3.7.2, but should work from Python 3.3 on (no guarantee given). You can easily try this out on your own machine. Clone the repo and then run (in a UNIX-derivate OS) `source venv/bin/activate`. To get all the dependencies working then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. To get the app running, type `flask run` in a terminal that has the venv activated. This sets up a very basic server, which allows you to access the app in your browser under `https://localhost:5000`.

Next steps:
- add license 
- set up navigation between sub-urls
